# Acordion

## Overview
Acordion is an AI project written in Rust that creates a neural network agent to play the game of tic-tac-toe. The agent is trained against itself using reinforcement learning techniques to improve its gameplay over time.

## Features
- Utilizes a neural network implemented in Rust to make intelligent moves in the game of tic-tac-toe.
- Implements reinforcement learning to train the agent through self-play.
- Provides a cli interface to visualize the agent's gameplay and training progress.

## Installation.
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nightmare9801/TurboPI](https://github.com/Nightmare9801/Acordion

   cd Acordion

   cargo run
```

## Usage
1. Run the executable to start the training process.
2. Monitor the agent's progress through the cli interface.
3. Test the trained agent against yourself.
